        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
            <li>Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towl and season generously</li>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, over medium-high heat. Add the lardons or bacon and cook until golden, about 6-8 minutes. Remove the lardons with a slotted spoon and reserve, leaving the drippings in the pot.</li>
            <li>Add more oil if needed, then add the chicken, without overcrowding the pot. Depending on the size of your pot, you might need to work in batches. Brown the chicken on all sides until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the chicken to the plate with the lardons and reserve.</li>
            <li>If the chicken has rendered a lot of fat, drain or wipe off the excess (being careful not to disturb the browned bits from the bottom of the pot), leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pot.</li>
            <li>Lower heat to medium, then add the chopped onion and carrots. Cook until the onions have softened, about 3 minutes. Then, stir in the garlic and cook for a minute to release its aroma.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for about a minute, then add the flour and cook for another minute, to get rid of the raw flour taste.</li>
            <li>Pour in the red wine and add the thyme sprigs and bay leaf, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 10 minutes, skimming off the foam that rises to the surface.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock and season with salt and pepper. Once boiling, add back the chicken pieces, lardons and any juices that have collected on the plate.</li>
            <li>Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 45 minutes or until the chicken is very tender.</li>
        </ol>
